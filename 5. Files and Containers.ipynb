    "\n",
    "First, try reading the entire file all at once as a big string:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> with open('Data/portfolio.csv', 'rt') as f:\n",
    "        data = f.read()\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> data\n",
    "'name,shares,price\\n\"AA\",100,32.20\\n\"IBM\",50,91.10\\n\"CAT\",150,83.44\\n\"MSFT\",200,51.23\\n\"GE\",95,40.37\\n\"MSFT\",50,65.10\\n\"IBM\",100,70.44\\n'\n",
    ">>> print(data)\n",
    "name,shares,price\n",
    "\"AA\",100,32.20\n",
    "\"IBM\",50,91.10\n",
    "\"CAT\",150,83.44\n",
    "\"MSFT\",200,51.23\n",
    "\"GE\",95,40.37\n",
    "\"MSFT\",50,65.10\n",
    "\"IBM\",100,70.44\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, it should be noted that Python has two modes of output.  In the first mode where you type `data` at the prompt, Python shows you the raw string representation including quotes and escape codes.  When you type `print(data)`, you get the actual formatted output of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although reading a file all at once is simple, it is often not the most appropriate way to do it—especially if the file happens to be huge or if contains lines of text that you want to handle one at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To read a file line-by-line, use a for-loop like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> with open('Data/portfolio.csv', 'rt') as f:\n",
    "        for line in f:\n",
    "            print(line, end='')\n",
    "\n",
    "name,shares,price\n",
    "\"AA\",100,32.20\n",
    "\"IBM\",50,91.10\n",
    "...\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use this code as shown, lines are read until the end of the file is reached at which point the loop stops.\n",
    "\n",
    "On certain occasions, you might want to manually read or skip a *single* line of text (e.g., perhaps you want to skip the first line of column headers).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> f = open('Data/portfolio.csv', 'rt')\n",
    ">>> headers = next(f)\n",
    ">>> headers\n",
    "'name,shares,price\\n'\n",
    ">>> for line in f:\n",
    "    print(line, end='')\n",
    "\n",
    "\"AA\",100,32.20\n",
    "\"IBM\",50,91.10\n",
    "...\n",
    ">>> f.close()\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`next()` returns the next line of text in the file. If you were to call it repeatedly, you would get successive lines.\n",
    "However, just so you know, the `for` loop already uses `next()` to obtain its data. Thus, you normally wouldn’t call it directly unless you’re trying to explicitly skip or read a single line as shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you’re reading lines of a file, you can start to perform more processing such as splitting. For example, try this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> f = open('Data/portfolio.csv', 'rt')\n",
    ">>> headers = next(f).split(',')\n",
    ">>> headers\n",
    "['name', 'shares', 'price\\n']\n",
    ">>> for line in f:\n",
    "    row = line.split(',')\n",
    "    print(row)\n",
    "\n",
    "['\"AA\"', '100', '32.20\\n']\n",
    "['\"IBM\"', '50', '91.10\\n']\n",
    "...\n",
    ">>> f.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: In these examples, `f.close()` is being called explicitly because the `with` statement isn’t being used.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 5.2: Reading a data file\n",
    "The columns in `portfolio.csv` correspond to the stock name, number of shares, and purchase price of a single stock holding.  Write a program called `pcost.py` that opens this file, reads all lines, and calculates how much it cost to purchase all of the shares in the portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint: to convert a string to an integer, use `int(s)`. To convert a string to a floating point, use `float(s)`.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Your program should print output such as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "Total cost 44671.15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 5.3: Extracting Data From CSV Files\n",
    "Knowing how to use various combinations of list, set, and dictionary comprehensions can be useful in various forms of data processing. Here’s an example that shows how to extract selected columns from a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, read a row of header information from a CSV file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> import csv\n",
    ">>> f = open('Data/portfoliodate.csv')\n",
    ">>> rows = csv.reader(f)\n",
    ">>> headers = next(rows)\n",
    ">>> headers\n",
    "['name', 'date', 'time', 'shares', 'price']\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, define a variable that lists the columns that you actually care about:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> select = ['name', 'shares', 'price']\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, locate the indices of the above columns in the source CSV file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> indices = [ headers.index(colname) for colname in select ]\n",
    ">>> indices\n",
    "[0, 3, 4]\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, read a row of data and turn it into a dictionary using a dictionary comprehension:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> row = next(rows)\n",
    ">>> record = { colname: row[index] for colname, index in zip(select, indices) }   # dict-comprehension\n",

    "{'price': '32.20', 'name': 'AA', 'shares': '100'}\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",

    "If you’re feeling comfortable with what just happened, read the rest of the file:\n",
    "\n",

    ">>> portfolio = [ { colname: row[index] for colname, index in zip(select, indices) } for row in rows ]\n",

    "### Exercise 5.4: A list of tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "The file `Data/portfolio.csv` contains a list of stocks in a portfolio.  In Exercise 5.2, you wrote a function `portfolio_cost(filename)` that read this file and performed a simple calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your code should have looked something like this:\n",

    "```python\n",

    "import csv\n",
    "\n",
    "def portfolio_cost(filename):\n",
    "    '''Computes the total cost (shares*price) of a portfolio file'''\n",
    "    total_cost = 0.0\n",
    "\n",

    "        rows = csv.reader(f)\n",

    "            total_cost += nshares * price\n",
    "    return total_cost\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this code as a rough guide, create a new file `report.py`.  In that file, define a function `read_portfolio(filename)` that opens a given portfolio file and reads it into a list of tuples.  To do this, you’re going to make a few minor modifications to the above code.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, instead of defining `total_cost = 0`, you’ll make a variable that’s initially set to an empty list. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "portfolio = []\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, instead of totaling up the cost, you’ll turn each row into a tuple exactly as you just did in the last exercise and append it to this list. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for row in rows:\n",
